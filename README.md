# THE BELOW DICTATES CONTINUOUS DATA-INJECTIVITY AND COPUTABILITY IN DL-STARSYSTEMS. HERE
# FOLLOWS ONE IMPLEMENTATION OF 

 An AI for everyone, by everyone, the usefulness of which becomes clear 
 in everyday wonder at connections in anything. It's not about where the connections 
 lie, but the connection itself and the extensions of knowledge that can be derived 
 from it. So that all forms of enlightenment can be extracted from the things we 
 observe, and that enlightenment is stored in an external entity that will be as 
 close to objectivity as possible, at least as true as functionally necessary. 
 It will serve as an Encyclopedia for Humanity, so that people can turn to it 
 for guidance in knowledge, science, law, and, ultimately, life orientation. 
 So that someone in Japan knows how many fish live in a local river based on 
 the good or bad experience of a fellow human being in a territory flagged to 
 Canada. So that learning truly happens, not just in our heads but in an external 
 entity, most accessible through and derived from reality, whatever that may be. 
 So that major conflicts and wars can be avoided as there is a right answer, 
 so that we know what to aim for, so that we know how to navigate the universe
 in the desired event that interstellar travel becomes something grand.

# WE BUT NEED TO INTEGRATE ONLINE ACTIVITY. HOW DOES ONE PROCEED THEREIN?
# IDEA: INTEGRATE DL-STARSYSTEM BACKEND TO A WWW INTERFACE FOR MASSIVE ONLINE DATA-INJECTION.
